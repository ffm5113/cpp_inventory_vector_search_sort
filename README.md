# cpp_inventory_vector_search_sort
The Inventory Vector Search/Sort Program (C++) reads an Inventory.Parts.txt file made of a list of a part records containing part names, categories, quantities, and unit costs. The program prompts the user to search for parts, and if a part is not found, the user can add a new part record. An updated txt file is written on program close. 

Notable software engineering features:
<ul>
  <li>Insertion sort algorithm of an inventory vector of part objects</li>
  <li>Binary search algorithm to find index of part by part number</li>
  <li>Reference variables used as parameters</li>
  <li>Custom Part data structure</li>
  <li>Data validation and formatting</li>
  <li>Input/output file streams and string stream objects</li>
</ul>
