# cpp_inventory_vector_search_sort
The Inventory Vector Search/Sort Program (C++) reads an Inventory.Parts.txt file made of a list of a part records containing part names, categories, quantities, and unit costs. The program prompts the user to search for parts, and if a part is not found, the user can add a new part record. An updated txt file is written on program close.
